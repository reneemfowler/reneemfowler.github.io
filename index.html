            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time I had a successful career as a Business Analyst where I was able to learn how to build software with the user in mind (and what happens when you don’t). I loved the majority of the work that I did, but I found myself constantly longing for something that would also allow me to tap into my creative side. I began reading and learning about UX/UI Design and found that it was the perfect step towards a career that would keep me challenged, both intellectually and artistically. <br/>I’m currently working as a contract UX/UI & Web Designer for three companies located across North America and I’m also working on developing a product of my own that is planned to launch in 2018.</p>
